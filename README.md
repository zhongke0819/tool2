## Deployment Instructions

### Frontend Deployment

1. Upload all files to your web host
2. Ensure the domain (tiktoktool.org) is correctly configured to point to your host
3. Configure HTTPS certificate to ensure secure connections

### Backend API Deployment (Optional)

To implement the actual TikTok video download functionality, you need to develop and deploy a backend API. Recommended technology stack:

- Node.js/Express or Python/Flask
- Use youtube-dl or similar tools to process video downloads
- Configure appropriate caching mechanisms to improve performance
- Set up rate limiting to prevent abuse

Example API endpoint:
```
POST /api/download
Body: { "url": "https://www.tiktok.com/@username/video/1234567890123456789" }
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "noWatermark": "https://tiktoktool.org/download/nowm_1234567890123456789.mp4",
    "withWatermark": "https://tiktoktool.org/download/wm_1234567890123456789.mp4",
    "audio": "https://tiktoktool.org/download/audio_1234567890123456789.mp3"
  }
}
```

1. Modify HTML/CSS/JS files
2. Test the display effect on different devices and browsers
3. Optimize resources, compress CSS and JavaScript files
